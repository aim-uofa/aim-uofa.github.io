# Omni-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Omnimodal Reasoning via Two-System Collaboration

This is the project homepage for **Omni-R1**, a novel reinforcement learning framework for omnimodal reasoning.

## Overview

Omni-R1 leverages two-system collaboration between fast intuitive processing and slow deliberative reasoning to enable comprehensive understanding and reasoning across multiple modalities including text, images, audio, and video.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Two-System Collaboration**: Combines System 1 (fast, intuitive) with System 2 (slow, analytical) processing
- 🔄 **Reinforcement Learning**: Advanced RL framework for optimal reasoning strategies
- 🎯 **Omnimodal Processing**: Seamless integration across text, images, audio, and video
- ⚡ **Efficient Architecture**: Balanced computational efficiency with high-quality performance
- 🖼️ **Interactive Visual Examples**: Single-column full-width layout with click-to-zoom functionality
