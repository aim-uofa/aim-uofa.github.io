The video begins with a close-up of a blue and white restroom sign, featuring two pictograms of a female on the left and a male on the right, with a horizontal line dividing them. The sign is mounted on a wall, likely in a public restroom. At the two-second mark, the same sign is shown with a blurred background, suggesting movement. By the fourth second, the scene shifts to a man and a woman dancing on an asphalt surface at night, dressed in casual attire, with the woman in a yellow dress and the man in a white shirt and black trousers, both smiling and enjoying their dance.
